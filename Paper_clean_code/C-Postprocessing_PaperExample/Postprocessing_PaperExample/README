#In this folder there are these folders:

in this folder there are there files:

template_runanalysisR2B5_1980-1990.sh
this is the template for the analysis run that will calculate global outputs

template_runanalysisR2B5_1980-1990_NAO_SOO.sh
this is the template for the analysis run that will calculate outputs regionally averaged on NAO (North Atlantic Ocean) or SOO (Southern Ocean)

template_run_analysis_R2B5_1980-1990-2ndtuningstep_60NandS_10and1000hPa.sh
this is the template for the analysis run that will calculate outputs zonally averaged on 60degN or 60degS and at the level 10hPa or 1000hPa

1_LHCPPE_create_analysis_runfiles_2ndtuningstep_PhyDynParam_5thPPE_AllAnalysis.sh
this is the script that will create the analysis scripts: it copies the template scripts listed above, and edits them according to the number of the run of the PPE
/!\ for a new PPE change the names of the files, or they may be overwritten
example :
for the run number 0 of the PPE there are these run_analysis scripts. Each of the scripts is producing a table with outputs metrics in it. The "defaults" one called "run_analysis_R2B5_1980-1990_nrun_0-2ndtuningstep_PhyDynParam_5thPPE.sh" produces the global averages of all the output metrics previously avaible in the postprocessing script handed by Renate. And then the others are modified from that default one, in order to calculate regional averages only for some variables: in one case it is variable "ua" at 60N or 60S and 10hPa or 1000hPa and in the other case variable "tauu"at the North Atlantic Ocean NAO or at the Southern Ocean SOO:

2_LHCPPE_submit_analysis_runfiles-2ndtuningstep_5thPPE_AllAnalysis.sh
this is the script that will run the analysis scripts created by "1_..."

2ndtuningstepsample_PhyDynParam_5thPPE_Epen_R0top_Cvtfall_Crs_Csatsc_Cd_G_sTI_Gpicmea_Gstd-*
parameter list that was used to create the ICON PPE

and other directory:
/1-postprocessing # in this folder there are sripts called by the run files
/2-analysis # the same in this folder
/log # the logs files are saved automatically here

#What the user has to do

before hand:
run the ICON runs 
copy the parameter list that was created to run the PPE in the run/ folder (note that the parameter list is just used here to know the length of the PPE)
edit the 1_... and 2_... files with the correct name of the PPE runs and edit the name of the files that will be created

Then, when ready:
create the postprocessing runfiles: $bash 1_...
submit the posprocessing runfiles: $bash 2_...
